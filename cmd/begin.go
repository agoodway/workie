// beginCmd represents the begin command
var beginCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "begin [branch-name]",
	Short: "Begin working on a new branch by creating a worktree",
	Long: `Begin creates a new Git worktree for isolated development on a branch.

This command will:
1. Create a new branch (or checkout an existing one)
2. Set up a worktree directory alongside your main repository
3. Copy essential files and configurations from .workie.yaml
4. Execute any post_create hooks to set up your environment
5. List all active worktrees to show your development environments

The worktree will be created in a directory named after your repository
with a "-worktrees" suffix, keeping your development organized.

Configuration is read from .workie.yaml (or workie.yaml) and can specify:
- Files and directories to copy to new worktrees
- Post-creation hooks for environment setup
- Pre-removal hooks for cleanup tasks

Use this to start working on a new feature, bugfix, or experiment without
affecting your main working directory.`,
	Example: `  # Begin work on a new feature
  workie begin feature/user-auth

  # Begin work on an AI integration feature
  workie begin feature/ai-integration

  # Begin a hotfix with custom configuration
  workie begin hotfix/security-patch --config .workie-production.yaml

  # Begin work silently for automation
  workie begin feature/ci-pipeline --quiet

  # Begin with detailed output for debugging
  workie begin feature/complex-setup --verbose`,
